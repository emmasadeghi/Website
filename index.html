            8/21-8/24: Week 1<br>
            This was my first week in Intro to Engineering!<br>
            During our lectures this week, we learned about the engineering process and saftey and etiquette in the engineering environment.<br>
            The engineering process is similar to the scientific process, but much more detailed. The process involves 7 steps which can be<br>
            utilized in a feed back loop to design and continually improve projects we do in class. Though larger engineering industries use<br>
            this process to find solutions to large scale issues. Our safety and etiquette lecture focused on proper ways to use materials in<br>
            the classroom to ensure the safety of yourself and others. It also touched on the safety requirements of large engineering companies,<br>
            which are much stricter on safety due to having larger scale projects. To end the week we had our first challenge! The class was split<br>
            into two large groups and tasked to roll a marble across the school quad and into a small bucket, using only a few halves of PVC pipes.<br> 
            We weren't allowed to touch the marble while on the trail, overlap the pipes, or move the ball backwards. Our team immediatley came up<br>
            with a plan to line up the pipes and run to the end of the line while the ball rolls. After a few failed trials, and some more<br>
            communication among our team, we made it to the bucket!! Well, sort of. We didn't actually get the marble inside the bucket, but at<br> 
            least we made it to the end. I really enjoyed my first week in this class, and am excited for the rest of the year! :)<br>
