            This was my first week in Intro to Engineering!<br>
            During our lectures this week, we learned about the engineering process and saftey and etiquette in the engineering environment.<br>
            The engineering process is similar to the scientific process, but much more detailed. The process involves 7 steps which can be<br>
            utilized in a feed back loop to design and continually improve projects we do in class. Though larger engineering industries use<br>
            this process to find solutions to large scale issues. Our safety and etiquette lecture focused on proper ways to use materials in<br>
            the classroom to ensure the safety of yourself and others. It also touched on the safety requirements of large engineering companies,<br>
            which are much stricter on safety due to having larger scale projects. To end the week we had our first challenge! The class was split<br>
            into two large groups and tasked to roll a marble across the school quad and into a small bucket, using only a few halves of PVC pipes.<br> 
            We weren't allowed to touch the marble while on the trail, overlap the pipes, or move the ball backwards. Our team immediatley came up<br>
            with a plan to line up the pipes and run to the end of the line while the ball rolls. After a few failed trials, and some more<br>
            communication among our team, we made it to the bucket!! Well, sort of. We didn't actually get the marble inside the bucket, but at<br> 
            least we made it to the end. I really enjoyed my first week in this class, and am excited for the rest of the year! :)<br>

            This week and engineering we learned about mechanical engineering and all the different jobs and components that make up the branch.<br>
            I learned that mechanical engineering is the most broad of all different engineering branches, making it a convenient field to get<br>
            a degree in because of the variety of job opportunies. We also started to deisgn 3D models on Tinkercad, specifically for our<br>
            upcoming Rube Goldberg projects. The goal of the project is to get a baseball to pop a balloon after going through multiple simple<br>
            machines (such as a pulley, incline, lever, etc.). It has been a bit difficult getting used to the world of Tinkercad, but I am enjoying<br>
            the learning curve. Our challenge this week also involved Tinkercad. We were asked to build a realistic home appliance using basic shapes<br>
            only, and I picked a toaster with a sandwhich. I think I did pretty good for one of my first builds, but I believe I will be able to<br> 
            improve its realism the more I familiarize myself with Tinkercad. All in all, it was a good week with new experiences.<br>
            Excited to see what next week holds! :)<br>

             This week was a short but eventful week! We began our week learning more about mechanical enginnering and watched a crash course on the<br>
             beginnings of mechanical engineering. The most signifigant thing I learned about was how mechanical engineers were the minds behind many<br>
             of the first tools, locomotives, and engines. We then continued to CAD (another thing I learned this week; basically using comupter technology<br>
             to create design documentation) our Rube Goldberg designes on Tinkercad. And to end the week we began to physically create our projects based on<br>
             CAD. We don't have much to show yet, but we started to cut out our pieces out of cardboard. Our next step would be combining all our pieces<br>
             to create the base of the course, before adding the finishing details. Hopefully we will finish our project soon and our tests will be<br>
             successful.<br>

             Rube Goldberg Week! We spent all our class time this week working on building, testing, and improving upon our projects. The goal of the project was<br>
             to start with a baseball and create a machine which resulted in the popping of a balloon. We had limited supplies, and had to incorporate 3 of the 6<br>
             simple machines. My team built an inclined plane, lever, and car out of cardboard as our machines. All 3 machines worked in conjunction to maneuver<br>
             the ball through our structure and resulted in the balloon popping. Although we were successful in the end, we did face some issues with our design.<br>
             We initially hoped to incorporate a pulley into our project, but could not due to time constrains. Then we faced an issue with the car and needle; the<br>
             car would roll into the balloon but didn't pop it. Thus we made some adjustments, and ultimatley popped it! This project was a bit frustrating, but fun<br>
             nonetheless!<br>

             We started our lessons with 2 challenges. For the first one, we were tasked with creating a flotation device that can<br>
             hold weight for 5 minutes, using only a singular piece of paper. Though, my device only held 64grams for about 30 seconds.<br>
             If given more time, I definitely believe my design could've been better. Our second challenge was to draw a capital letter<br>
             "E" with dimensions that somebody else would be responsible for cutting out. This really helped me focus on being clear and<br>
             detailed when providing instructions. I think my design was great, and I put a lot of thought into it. Finally, we wrapped <br>
             up the week with a lesson on computer engineering, with focuses on computer science and electronic engineering. I enjoyed<br>
             this weeks challenges and am excited for more!<br>

             This week we learned about the different parts of a computer and their fuctions within its system. And after learning<br>
             about each component, we got to dissect an old PC and physically look at all the pieces. It was actually a bit harder<br>
             than I expected. We came across some missing pieces and random wires that confused us when disassembling the computer<br>
             but we were able to work around them and successfully disscet the entire computer. Our last task was to put it back<br>
             together exactly how it was at the beginning. It was very cool getting to actually see the things we learn about, I<br>
             enjoyed this activity alot.<br>

             This week we learned about the field of biological engineering (aka bioengineering). It's a very complex field as it<br>
             integrates many other engineering fields and disciplines. A real life example of bioengineering are medical prosthetics<br>
             for missing organs, limbs, etc. We saw an example of an artificial heart made of silicone that actually pumps blood, but<br>
             it is still in testing for long term use. We then got to create our own prostetic hand out of cardboard and string; our<br>
             goal was to pick up a water bottle with our prosthetic. We faced some issues with our initial design that we only realized<br>
             while testing, so we went back to our design and adjusted it. After a few changes to our design and lot os testing we were<br>
             successful! We also did another prostetic challenge on Tinkercad where we designed a prostethic for a specific animal. I chose<br>
             to do a prosthetic leg for a dog, and I took inspiration from prostetic legs made for olympic sprinters. This would allow the<br> 
             dog to run around and be active without issues.<br>

             This week in engineering we learned abour aerospace engineering! The field focues primarily on spaceships and their<br>
             manufacturing, which is extremely cool in my opinion. Our project for this field will be making a rocket out of a plastic<br>
             bottle; that we will launch by pressurizing it. I began to CAD my idea on Tinkercad, but right now it's fairly simple.<br>
             I want to craft the rocket so its feature will help it push through the air and travel as far as possible. I plan to improve<br>
             design and brainstorm other ideas with my team before we begin building and testing.<br>

             This week in engineering we built and tested our own bottle rockets. My partner and I designed our rocket with a set of wind and<br>
             cone top, in order to break through the air. Our design ws fairly simple, but it was practical and effective for our needs.<br>
             For our test we decided to fill our bottle with abour 35% water, and around 50PSIs of pressure. Our test was semi-successful. The<br>
             rocket travelled quite far but did spiral and turn sharply left instead of flying straight. If we were to alter our design, I would<br>
             add more components to the bottle that would balance out the plane and prevent it from redirecting its course. For the time and<br>
             we had I would say we had a successful project!

             This week we learned about environmental engineers. Their jobs is to ensure the enviornment around us is sustainable enough to<br>
             support humans. Some of the tasks they deal with is water treatment, disposal of wastes, and pollution, but there a surplus of<br>
             other tasks to solve environmental issues across our land, water, and air. For our environmental project we were tasked to create<br>
             a water filter using an empty bottle and various earthy resources. In my design, I layered cotton balls, sand, small pebbles, and<br>
             large rocks, to help filter out the water by removing the larger contaminents, then removing the progessively smaller ones. After<br>
             passing the dirty water through the filter about 7 times, the water got progessively and signifigntly clearer with every filtration.<br>
             I would say it was successful, but if I were to do it again I would have cleaned my filter between each filtration to avoid older<br>
             contaminents interfering with the now filtered water.

             This week we learned about electrical engineering. Electrical engineers focus on designing, studying, and using various eletrical<br>
             and appliances. We also learned about Ohm's law which allowed us to calculate voltage, current, resistance, and power of an applicance,<br>
             depending on different circumstances, using math. We then began to learn how to work with our own circuits through Tinkercad. We created<br>
             three different circuite which used a battery to power a LED light. It got increasingly difficult with each circuit as the placement of the<br>
             lights changed and more connections were needed to power them. However after lots of trial and error, I completed all the circuits successfully!<br>
