            This was my first week in Intro to Engineering!<br>
            During our lectures this week, we learned about the engineering process and saftey and etiquette in the engineering environment.<br>
            The engineering process is similar to the scientific process, but much more detailed. The process involves 7 steps which can be<br>
            utilized in a feed back loop to design and continually improve projects we do in class. Though larger engineering industries use<br>
            this process to find solutions to large scale issues. Our safety and etiquette lecture focused on proper ways to use materials in<br>
            the classroom to ensure the safety of yourself and others. It also touched on the safety requirements of large engineering companies,<br>
            which are much stricter on safety due to having larger scale projects. To end the week we had our first challenge! The class was split<br>
            into two large groups and tasked to roll a marble across the school quad and into a small bucket, using only a few halves of PVC pipes.<br> 
            We weren't allowed to touch the marble while on the trail, overlap the pipes, or move the ball backwards. Our team immediatley came up<br>
            with a plan to line up the pipes and run to the end of the line while the ball rolls. After a few failed trials, and some more<br>
            communication among our team, we made it to the bucket!! Well, sort of. We didn't actually get the marble inside the bucket, but at<br> 
            least we made it to the end. I really enjoyed my first week in this class, and am excited for the rest of the year! :)<br>

            This week and engineering we learned about mechanical engineering and all the different jobs and components that make up the branch.<br>
            I learned that mechanical engineering is the most broad of all different engineering branches, making it a convenient field to get<br>
            a degree in because of the variety of job opportunies. We also started to deisgn 3D models on Tinkercad, specifically for our<br>
            upcoming Rube Goldberg projects. The goal of the project is to get a baseball to pop a balloon after going through multiple simple<br>
            machines (such as a pulley, incline, lever, etc.). It has been a bit difficult getting used to the world of Tinkercad, but I am enjoying<br>
            the learning curve. Our challenge this week also involved Tinkercad. We were asked to build a realistic home appliance using basic shapes<br>
            only, and I picked a toaster with a sandwhich. I think I did pretty good for one of my first builds, but I believe I will be able to<br> 
            improve its realism the more I familiarize myself with Tinkercad. All in all, it was a good week with new experiences.<br>
            Excited to see what next week holds! :)<br>

             This week was a short but eventful week! We began our week learning more about mechanical enginnering and watched a crash course on the<br>
             beginnings of mechanical engineering. The most signifigant thing I learned about was how mechanical engineers were the minds behind many<br>
             of the first tools, locomotives, and engines. We then continued to CAD (another thing I learned this week; basically using comupter technology<br>
             to create design documentation) our Rube Goldberg designes on Tinkercad. And to end the week we began to physically create our projects based on<br>
             CAD. We don't have much to show yet, but we started to cut out our pieces out of cardboard. Our next step would be combining all our pieces<br>
             to create the base of the course, before adding the finishing details. Hopefully we will finish our project soon and our tests will be<br>
             successful.<br>

             Rube Goldberg Week! We spent all our class time this week working on building, testing, and improving upon our projects. The goal of the project was<br>
             to start with a baseball and create a machine which resulted in the popping of a balloon. We had limited supplies, and had to incorporate 3 of the 6<br>
             simple machines. My team built an inclined plane, lever, and car out of cardboard as our machines. All 3 machines worked in conjunction to maneuver<br>
             the ball through our structure and resulted in the balloon popping. Although we were successful in the end, we did face some issues with our design.<br>
             We initially hoped to incorporate a pulley into our project, but could not due to time constrains. Then we faced an issue with the car and needle; the<br>
             car would roll into the balloon but didn't pop it. Thus we made some adjustments, and ultimatley popped it! This project was a bit frustrating, but fun<br>
             nonetheless!<br>

             We started our lessons with 2 challenges. For the first one, we were tasked with creating a flotation device that can<br>
             hold weight for 5 minutes, using only a singular piece of paper. Though, my device only held 64grams for about 30 seconds.<br>
             If given more time, I definitely believe my design could've been better. Our second challenge was to draw a capital letter<br>
             "E" with dimensions that somebody else would be responsible for cutting out. This really helped me focus on being clear and<br>
             detailed when providing instructions. I think my design was great, and I put a lot of thought into it. Finally, we wrapped <br>
             up the week with a lesson on computer engineering, with focuses on computer science and electronic engineering. I enjoyed<br>
             this weeks challenges and am excited for more!<br>

             This week we learned about the different parts of a computer and their fuctions within its system. And after learning<br>
             about each component, we got to dissect an old PC and physically look at all the pieces. It was actually a bit harder<br>
             than I expected. We came across some missing pieces and random wires that confused us when disassembling the computer<br>
             but we were able to work around them and successfully disscet the entire computer. Our last task was to put it back<br>
             together exactly how it was at the beginning. It was very cool getting to actually see the things we learn about, I<br>
             enjoyed this activity alot.<br>

             This week we learned about the field of biological engineering (aka bioengineering). It's a very complex field as it<br>
             integrates many other engineering fields and disciplines. A real life example of bioengineering are medical prosthetics<br>
             for missing organs, limbs, etc. We saw an example of an artificial heart made of silicone that actually pumps blood, but<br>
             it is still in testing for long term use. We then got to create our own prostetic hand out of cardboard and string; our<br>
             goal was to pick up a water bottle with our prosthetic. We faced some issues with our initial design that we only realized<br>
             while testing, so we went back to our design and adjusted it. After a few changes to our design and lot os testing we were<br>
             successful! We also did another prostetic challenge on Tinkercad where we designed a prostethic for a specific animal. I chose<br>
             to do a prosthetic leg for a dog, and I took inspiration from prostetic legs made for olympic sprinters. This would allow the<br> 
             dog to run around and be active without issues.<br>

             This week in engineering we learned abour aerospace engineering! The field focues primarily on spaceships and their<br>
             manufacturing, which is extremely cool in my opinion. Our project for this field will be making a rocket out of a plastic<br>
             bottle; that we will launch by pressurizing it. I began to CAD my idea on Tinkercad, but right now it's fairly simple.<br>
             I want to craft the rocket so its feature will help it push through the air and travel as far as possible. I plan to improve<br>
             design and brainstorm other ideas with my team before we begin building and testing.<br>

             This week in engineering we built and tested our own bottle rockets. My partner and I designed our rocket with a set of wind and<br>
             cone top, in order to break through the air. Our design ws fairly simple, but it was practical and effective for our needs.<br>
             For our test we decided to fill our bottle with abour 35% water, and around 50PSIs of pressure. Our test was semi-successful. The<br>
             rocket travelled quite far but did spiral and turn sharply left instead of flying straight. If we were to alter our design, I would<br>
             add more components to the bottle that would balance out the plane and prevent it from redirecting its course. For the time and<br>
             we had I would say we had a successful project!

             This week we learned about environmental engineers. Their jobs is to ensure the enviornment around us is sustainable enough to<br>
             support humans. Some of the tasks they deal with is water treatment, disposal of wastes, and pollution, but there a surplus of<br>
             other tasks to solve environmental issues across our land, water, and air. For our environmental project we were tasked to create<br>
             a water filter using an empty bottle and various earthy resources. In my design, I layered cotton balls, sand, small pebbles, and<br>
             large rocks, to help filter out the water by removing the larger contaminents, then removing the progessively smaller ones. After<br>
             passing the dirty water through the filter about 7 times, the water got progessively and signifigntly clearer with every filtration.<br>
             I would say it was successful, but if I were to do it again I would have cleaned my filter between each filtration to avoid older<br>
             contaminents interfering with the now filtered water.

             This week we learned about electrical engineering. Electrical engineers focus on designing, studying, and using various eletrical<br>
             and appliances. We also learned about Ohm's law which allowed us to calculate voltage, current, resistance, and power of an applicance,<br>
             depending on different circumstances, using math. We then began to learn how to work with our own circuits through Tinkercad. We created<br>
             three different circuite which used a battery to power a LED light. It got increasingly difficult with each circuit as the placement of the<br>
             lights changed and more connections were needed to power them. However after lots of trial and error, I completed all the circuits successfully!<br>

             This week we strated to work with physical breadboard. We were assigned different patters to recreate with LEd lights through the use of<br>
             an arduino. Within the ardunio interface we were required to code our patterns digitally and then connect our code to our board to activate<br>
             our LED's. I encounted many issues with both the coding and our board setup. It was quite hard to find the correct placement of wire to<br>
             ensure all the LED would act as wanted. The code itself also presented challenges as it was my first time coding something of this sort.<br>
             However, in the end I was able to successfully code and execute all the patterns!<br>

             This week we learned about buisness engineering. These engineers utilize consumer needs to design and market products to audiences with<br>
             the intention of solving current issues. For our buisness engineering project, we will be creating a product and pitching it--similar to<br>
             Shark Tank. We have just started the brainstorming process and have yet to finalize our product. Currently we intent to creat a self-dispening<br>
             pill bottle which aids older demographics by reminidng them to take their meds by emitting noise, and prevents overdoses by regulating the number<br>
             of pills dispensed. We may change our idea in the future but this is simply our current idea.

             This week we continued to work on and present our Shark Tank product pitch. My group and I decided to create and app that automatically finds and<br>
             matches students to scholarships, internships, and volunteer opportunies related to their major of interest. The app also assist students better their<br>
             transcripts to stand out among your peers, while also preparing them for what their major may entail. The other groups has some cool ideas aswell, my<br>
             was a wireless measuring tool to create a hassle free, effective replacement for traditional measuring tapes. All the other ideas were ery unique and<br>
             most semeed feasible and helpful!

            <b>Bridge Analysis</b><br>
            </summary>
        1. What was the weight of your bridge?<br>
        70 grams<br>
        <br>
        2.What was the weight held by your bridge?<br>
        3408 grams<br>
        <br>
        3. What was the ratio of weight of bridge to weight held?<br>
        49 grams of weight per gram on bridge<br>
        <br>
        4. What was the heaviest part of your bridge? What contributed most to the weight?<br>
        The base of our bridge was the heaviest as it had the most spaghetti. It also had quite a lot of glue to keep secure and thus added onto the weight of the<br>
        spaghetti. However, it was the most structurally sound part of the bridge and contributed heavily to our bridges success.<br>
        <br>
        5. Where did the design of your bridge come from? Inspiration? Research?<br>
        <br>
        6. Did the design work as intended? Better? Worse?<br>
        <br>
        7. What was the point of failure of your bridge? Was that the expected weakest point?<br>
        <br>
        8. What can you do to improve your bridge? What can prolong points of failure?<br>
        <br>
        9. Post building progress photos of your bridge<br>
        10. Post photos of before your bridge<br>
        11. Post a video of your bridge<br>

             During our first week of the semester we learned about chemical engineering! It's a very interesting branch that deals with chemical entitys of various<br>
             types. It's a very large branch of engineering with lots of sub-catergories of engineers. We also experimented with our own chemical engineering project.<br>
             by trying to make oobleck. It's an interensint substance that's matter fluctuates between a liquid and solid depending on the force upon it. It was really<br>
             fun to make and interesting to play with due to its changing form. This week's lesson was very insteresting, chemical engineering is a definitely field I may<br>
             look into for the future.

             This week we started a new project; mouse trap cars! We began our initial research and design process by looking up optimal designs for our car. We referred to<br>
             multiple sources and videos to determine what shapes and structures will increase our cars chances at success. We currently have a simple design that will reduce<br>
             the cars weight and hopefully maximize its travelling distance. Though, we plan to add on to our design as needed to to ensure our car moves smoothly and effectively<br>
             We created a project proposal for our car in which we described our intention in building the car as well as a BOM of all our necessary materials.<br>

             This week we took a lesson on the math and calculations that would help us optimize our cars travelling distance. The lesson was very beneficial in giving<br>
             us an estimate of our car's potential. We used the math to scale the dimensions of our mouse trap car. According to our estimate, if created effecitvely,<br>
             our car should travel 70ft. We used our new scaled deisg to create our car on TinkerCAD, giving us a visual of our cars final design. Next week we will<br>
             begin the building process, specifically I hope to complete the base of our car so we have ample time to alter our design if needed.<br>
