            This was my first week in Intro to Engineering!<br>
            During our lectures this week, we learned about the engineering process and saftey and etiquette in the engineering environment.<br>
            The engineering process is similar to the scientific process, but much more detailed. The process involves 7 steps which can be<br>
            utilized in a feed back loop to design and continually improve projects we do in class. Though larger engineering industries use<br>
            this process to find solutions to large scale issues. Our safety and etiquette lecture focused on proper ways to use materials in<br>
            the classroom to ensure the safety of yourself and others. It also touched on the safety requirements of large engineering companies,<br>
            which are much stricter on safety due to having larger scale projects. To end the week we had our first challenge! The class was split<br>
            into two large groups and tasked to roll a marble across the school quad and into a small bucket, using only a few halves of PVC pipes.<br> 
            We weren't allowed to touch the marble while on the trail, overlap the pipes, or move the ball backwards. Our team immediatley came up<br>
            with a plan to line up the pipes and run to the end of the line while the ball rolls. After a few failed trials, and some more<br>
            communication among our team, we made it to the bucket!! Well, sort of. We didn't actually get the marble inside the bucket, but at<br> 
            least we made it to the end. I really enjoyed my first week in this class, and am excited for the rest of the year! :)<br>

            <i>8/28-9/1:</i><br>
            This week and engineering we learned about mechanical engineering and all the different jobs and components that make up the branch.<br>
            I learned that mechanical engineering is the most broad of all different engineering branches, making it a convenient field to get<br>
            a degree in because of the variety of job opportunies. We also started to deisgn 3D models on Tinkercad, specifically for our<br>
            upcoming Rube Goldberg projects. The goal of the project is to get a baseball to pop a balloon after going through multiple simple<br>
            machines (such as a pulley, incline, lever, etc.). It has been a bit difficult getting used to the world of Tinkercad, but I am enjoying<br>
            the learning curve. Our challenge this week also involved Tinkercad. We were asked to build a realistic home appliance using basic shapes<br>
            only, and I picked a toaster with a sandwhich. I think I did pretty good for one of my first builds, but I believe I will be able to<br> 
            improve its realism the more I familiarize myself with Tinkercad. All in all, it was a good week with new experiences.<br>
            Excited to see what next week holds! :)<br>
